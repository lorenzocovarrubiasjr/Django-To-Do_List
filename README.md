# Django-To-Do_List

One of my first Django projects. It has a SQLite3 Database set up to create new lists, add items to lists, change status's on items and delete items and lists in entirety. A mixture of Python  code & libraries and HTML. Will continue to update until it looks sexy and attractive.
